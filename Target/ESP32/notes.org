 
Board: HiLetgo ESP-WROOM-32 ESP32 ESP-32S Development Board

SoC  : Espressif ESP32D0WDQ6 (revision 1)

Processor: Tensilica Xtensa LX6

Ram, Flash, ... ??

* I decided to use the Arduino IDE. 

** In File, Preferences
Add to 'Additional Boards Managers URL':
https://dl.espressif.com/dl/package_esp32_index.json

** Select Tools, Board ESP32 Dev Module

** Select Port and Baud (115200)

** Click Upload, wait for Connecting.....

** Press IO0 button 
Button on the right when cable points down (ie Not the button labeled
EN) 

The code is flashed.



* Note: Required pressing a button on the board is annoying

* Was able to get working immediately
