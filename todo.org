The tether only knows about absolute addresses.

So maybe add a fixed buffer where info can be stored. 

Or "virtual registers".

Then make subrs like this
 
get_midr:
   msr x0, MIDR_EL1
   ldr x1, =buffer
   str x0, [x1]
   ret


* 4 byte read/write required for some mmio?

* 2 byte?

* Host should occasionally check for stray input bytes
